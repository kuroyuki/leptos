# Introduction

This book is intended as an introduction to the [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) Web framework. Together, we’ll build a simple todo app—first as a client-side app, then as a full-stack app.

The guide doesn’t assume you know anything about fine-grained reactivity or the details of modern Web frameworks. It does assume you are familiar with the Rust programming language, HTML, CSS, and the DOM and other Web APIs.

Leptos is most similar to frameworks like [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com) (JavaScript) and [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/) (Rust). There are some similarities to other frameworks like React (JavaScript), Yew (Rust), and Dioxus (Rust), so knowledge of one of those frameworks may also make it easier to understand Leptos.

You can find more detailed docs for each part of the API at [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/).

**The guide is a work in progress.**
